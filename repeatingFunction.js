// We want to be able to modify any given function, creating a clone of it which, when called, repeats the given function several times.
// On creation of the new clone function, we need to be able to specify how many times the given function should be repeated.
// As such, your task is to define a function `createRepeatingClone`, that works exactly as described above & depicted below.

// sayHelloTo is a demo function, which we'll use as test input for `createRepeatingClone`
function sayHelloTo(name) {
  console.log(`Hello ${name}!`);
  return "Successful";
}

// `createRepeatingClone` should be used as follows:
const sayHelloTo3Times = createRepeatingClone(sayHelloTo, 3);
const returnedArray = sayHelloTo3Times("Arjun");
// ðŸ–¨Desired Output:
// Hello Arjun!
// Hello Arjun!
// Hello Arjun!

console.log(returnedArray);
// ðŸ–¨Desired Output:
// ["Successful", "Successful", "Successful"]


// And now, you're up. Good luck!
function createRepeatingClone(inputFunction, timesToRepeat){
  // Your code goes here. To make the problem more interesting, do not use any loops, or even `forEach()`.
}
